## Development Server

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to any of the source files.

```

You can also generate directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, and modules using:

```

## Build

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

```

This will execute the tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
